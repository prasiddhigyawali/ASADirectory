# ASADirectory
This repository will go on to hold an algorithm for processing of the ASA Directory to populate a directory.

As of right now the documents in this GitHub and their purpose is as follows:
	-- <b>codebook.pdf:</b> This PDF includes information on what the ASA is		as well as how to read entries in the directory
	-- <b>sample.pdf:</b> This is a sample of the ASA directory being used
		in development and testing of the algorithm to transform the ASA		directories into a database
	-- <b>sample.docx:</b> This docx file is what Adobe Acorbat was able to 		produce upon processing sample.pdf
