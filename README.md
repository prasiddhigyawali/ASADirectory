	<br>-- <b>codebook.pdf:</b> This PDF includes information on what the ASA is as well as how to read entries in the directory
	<br>-- <b>sample.pdf:</b> This is a sample of the ASA directory being used in development and testing of the algorithm to transform the AS directories into a database
	<br>-- <b>sample.docx:</b> This docx file is what Adobe Acorbat was abl to produce upon processing sample.pdf
	<br>-- <b>ASADirectory.py:</b> This is the python file which will be used to process the the directory data and fill the database
